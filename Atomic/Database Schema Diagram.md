- A Database Schema Diagram shows the structure of a database. It displays all [[table]]s and how they are connected.
- Each [[table]] (entity) is represented as a blue box. The name of the table is inside the box.
- [[Primary key]] [[attributes]] are underlined. These are unique identifiers for each row in a table.
- [[Foreign key]]s are shown with arrows. They point from one [[table]] to another. This shows how tables are linked.
- The diagram helps to understand the organisation of data. It also shows how information flows between tables.
- You can use the diagram to design, analyse or troubleshoot a database.
