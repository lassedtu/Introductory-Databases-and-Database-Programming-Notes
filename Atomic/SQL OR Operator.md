The `OR` operator is used to filter records based on more than one condition. It displays a record if ANY of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.

## Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
```

## Examples

**Two conditions:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Spain';
```

**Multiple conditions:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City = 'Berlin' OR City = 'MÃ¼nchen' OR City = 'Madrid';
```

**Combining with AND:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE (Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'Spain') AND CustomerName LIKE 'A%';
```

## Truth Table
| Condition1 | Condition2 | OR Result |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| TRUE | TRUE | TRUE |
| TRUE | FALSE | TRUE |
| FALSE | TRUE | TRUE |
| FALSE | FALSE | FALSE |

## Precedence
OR has lower precedence than AND. Use parentheses for clarity:
```sql
-- This might not work as expected:
WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND City = 'Berlin' OR City = 'Madrid'

-- Better with parentheses:
WHERE Country = 'Germany' AND (City = 'Berlin' OR City = 'Madrid')
```

## Alternative: IN Operator
For multiple values on the same column, consider [[SQL IN Operator]]:
```sql
-- Using OR
WHERE Country = 'Germany' OR Country = 'France' OR Country = 'UK'

-- Using IN (more concise)
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK')
```
