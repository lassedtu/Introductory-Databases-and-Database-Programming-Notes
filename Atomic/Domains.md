A domain is similar to a type. It's a set of allowed values (like datatypes) inside attributes (columns of the schema). An attribute value can only hold a single variable. A domain is a type of constraint which can be put on a database. If the domain isn't correct in what you're attempting to put into the database, the database will not allow you.

All domains (unless you explicitly forbid it) allow a specific value called [[Atomic/NULL]]. This value means that the value is unknown or unspecified.
